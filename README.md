# Simple DDD Toolkit üõ†Ô∏è

A simple Domain Driven Design Toolkit created to help developers to understand how to implement DDD concepts. It also contains some useful stuff not directly related to DDD, like a command bus or result pattern.

This toolkit is not a library, it's just a set of classes and interfaces that you can use, and it has no dependency. 

Note: This toolkit is still under development and not intended to be used in production. All classes and interfaces are subject to change.
